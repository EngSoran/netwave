## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep blue (#29ABE2) to convey trust, security, and professionalism, reflecting the nature of network solutions. The hue also connects with the high-tech aspects of the application.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated blue-gray (#F0F8FF) complements the primary blue while providing a subtle, non-distracting backdrop that is suitable for a light color scheme.
- Accent color: A vibrant, analogous color like turquoise (#7DF9FF) can highlight key interactive elements and CTAs to draw the user's attention.
- Font: 'PT Sans' for a humanist sans-serif providing a modern look and a touch of warmth, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Employ network-related icons with a modern, minimalist style. Ensure they are easily recognizable and align with the overall aesthetic.
- Implement a glassmorphism effect with interactive elements and color variations. The layout should be clean, intuitive, and responsive across devices.
- Use subtle transitions and animations for interactive elements to enhance the user experience without overwhelming them.
